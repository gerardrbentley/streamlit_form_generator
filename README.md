## What's this?

- `README.md`: This Document! To help you find your way around
- `streamlit_app.py`: The main app that gets run by [`streamlit`](https://docs.streamlit.io/)
- `requirements.txt`: Pins the version of packages needed
- `LICENSE`: Follows Streamlit's use of Apache 2.0 Open Source License
- `.gitignore`: Tells git to avoid comitting / scanning certain local-specific files
